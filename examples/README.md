# Examples

These are the canonical examples for using nats.ws on the browser. An example server configuration is included. You'll need to modify the location of the TLS certificates as necessary.

The nats-server websocket implementation only supports WSS, this means that you have to provide 
TLS certificates that are trusted by a browser in order to test and try the functionality.

For a instructions on how to create TLS certificates, [see this tutorial](https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/tls#creating-self-signed-certificates-for-testing).
